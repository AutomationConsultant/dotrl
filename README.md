## dotRL
Application allowing convenient experimentation in Reinforcement Learning - a Machine Learning domain.

Project goals are:
 - keep adding new environments and agents as simple as possible
 - provide a rich set of state-of-art algorithms and problems
 - integrate with other existing Reinforcement Learning platforms

## Previous releses

This project was previously hosted [on Source Forge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dotrl/). Currently, we are in the process of creating a new version with a more structured approach (better design, unit-tests, etc.) here.
