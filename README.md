## dotRL
Application allowing convenient experimentation in Reinforcement Learning - a Machine Learning domain.

Project goals are:
 - keep adding new environments and agents as simple as possible
 - provide a rich set of state-of-art algorithms and problems
 - integrate with other existing Reinforcement Learning platforms
