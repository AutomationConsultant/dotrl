1. How to setup the Private Build?
2. How to implement an Agent/Environment?
3. How to contact the authors?
4. How to reference this work?

1) In Visual Studio 2010 (should be similar in other versions):
   a) choose "Tools" -> "External tools"
   b) click "Add"
   c) fill the fields:
      Title: "dotRL private build" (or anything you want)
      Command: C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe
      Arguments: $(SolutionDir)\Build\BuildScripts\PrivateBuild.proj /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform="Any CPU"
      Initial directory: [leave empty]
      Use Output window: [checked]
      Prompt for arguments: [unchecked]
      Treat output as unicode: [unchecked]
   d) Press OK

   Then, after project has been built you can (and should) choose "Tools" -> "dotRL private build" (or the other title you have chosen)

2) 
   a) Choose appropriate folder depending the problem type you are interested in (continuous/discrete state/action)
   b) Create a class, with Agent/Environment baseclass and template arguments which match the problem type
      Name the class in a way that will clearly represent it's concept (e.g. don't you abbreviations)
      
   A simple examples you can base on are GridEnvironmentFlat and QLearningAgent

3) Send and an e-mail to 'bartoszkp@gmail.com'.
